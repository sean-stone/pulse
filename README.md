Pulse
This application animates any public feature service (or service with token).

Includes the ability to create an animation of a featurelayer. Animate by opacity, size (for point/line) and with a bunch of styling options.

Exports canvas to .mp4 video format. Note: as it records the cavnas, we then need to ensure attribution is correctly added.
